    <p class="paragraph paragraph-2">Historical records show that gangs often targeted cargo being transported on the River Thames. In 1844, it was reported that more than £500,000 worth of goods were stolen from ships and wharves on the Thames each year [1]. The presence of valuable goods, lack of security, and easy boat escapes made the river an appealing target for criminals. Smuggling was also a major issue, with gangs using the Thames to move illegal goods. In 1848, a Parliamentary report estimated that over £14 million worth of contraband was smuggled through the Port of London annually [2]. To combat the rise in crime, the world's first police force dedicated to a specific area, the Thames River Police, was established in 1800 [3]. Initially, there were only eight officers who patrolled the river to stop theft, smuggling, and other crimes [4]. By the mid-19th century, the force had grown to about 150 officers [5]. However, corruption soon took hold, with some officers reportedly working with the very criminals they were supposed to arrest, taking bribes and protecting certain gangs [6].<br><br></p>
