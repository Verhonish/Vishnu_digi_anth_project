The mission involves parkour navigation, time pressure, and the choice between stealth or combat. Successfully completing the mission allows Bell to transmit a breaking news story across London. In the Gang Stronghold Liberation mission, players work to weaken the Blighter gangâ€™s control over Whitechapel by kidnapping leaders, freeing child laborers, and assassinating targets. This leads to a Gang War event, where the player's gang, the Rooks, battles the Blighters. Victory shifts control of Whitechapel to the Rooks and unlocks new activities.<br><br></p>

    <p class="paragraph paragraph-2">Alexander Graham Bell, while not based in Whitechapel, had notable connections to London in the 1870s and 1880s. In 1878, he demonstrated his telephone to Queen Victoria at Osborne House, successfully transmitting "God Save the Queen" [1]. The first telephone exchange in England opened at 36 Coleman Street, London, on January 14, 1878 [2]. In contrast, Victorian Whitechapel was marked by extreme poverty and overcrowding. By 1901, it had a population density of 185 people per acre, compared to London's average of 35 [3]. A survey in 1887 found that 31% of Whitechapel residents lived in overcrowded conditions [4]. Poverty was severe, with Charles Booth's 1889 maps showing 35% of residents in abject poverty or chronic want [5]. The infant mortality rate in Whitechapel in the 1880s was 230 deaths per 1,000 live births, significantly higher than London's average of 158 [6]. Employment was precarious, with the casual labor market in Whitechapel meaning up to 25% of workers might be unemployed on any given day [7]. Crime rates were high, with 6,422 arrests in Whitechapel in 1888, or about 1 in 18 residents [8]. Despite reform efforts like the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, formed in 1888 [9], and the establishment of Toynbee Hall in 1884 [10], the scale of problems often overwhelmed these attempts at improvement, reflecting the challenges depicted in Assassin's Creed Syndicate.<br><br></p>
