            <p class="paragraph paragraph-3"><span class="paragraph-text-1">Mission 1 : A spoonful of syrup</span><br>In the mission "A Spoonful of Syrup" from Assassin's Creed Syndicate, players explore the harsh realities of industrial-era London, where corruption and exploitation are common. The mission focuses on a drug trafficking operation that preys on the city's most vulnerable people. A key location in this mission is the Lambeth Asylum, which, despite being called an asylum, acts more like a hospital for the poor and mentally ill. This reflects the tough and often unfair approach to healthcare during that time.<br>The main character, Jacob Frye, must sneak into the asylum to find out where the dangerous syrup—a highly addictive drug that keeps the working class under control—is coming from. The hospital, with its overcrowded and dismal conditions, highlights the poor quality of care available to the less fortunate during the Victorian era. The portrayal of Lambeth Asylum sheds light on the bigger social issues of the time, including the neglect of the mentally ill, the exploitation of vulnerable people, and the use of addiction as a means of control.<br></p>

    <p class="paragraph paragraph-2">The Lambeth Asylum in *Assassin's Creed Syndicate* is inspired by Bethlem Royal Hospital, commonly known as Bedlam. Founded in 1247, Bedlam is one of the oldest mental health institutions in the world [1]. By the 18th and 19th centuries, it became infamous for overcrowding and poor treatment of patients [2]. The hospital used harsh methods like rotational therapy, where patients were strapped to a chair and spun rapidly, and hydrotherapy, where they were suddenly dunked in cold water [3]. Bedlam was also notorious for allowing the public to visit and observe patients as a form of entertainment, further dehumanizing those inside [4]. This practice continued until 1770 when it was banned [5]. The hospital's reputation for mistreatment made it a subject of public fascination. For example, William Hogarth's series of paintings "A Rake's Progress" (1732-1734) depicted Bedlam in its final scene, capturing the public's morbid curiosity about the institution [6].<br><br></p>
