      <p class="paragraph paragraph-8">In conclusion, this project showed how interactive digital media can connect our understanding of history with our everyday lives. Players shared that exploring the gameâ€™s virtual London made them genuinely curious about the city's past, leading them to look up real historical events and places. For example, after the "A Spoonful of Syrup" mission, players were surprised to learn about the real Bedlam and its harsh treatment of patients, which led them to explore the history of mental health care.<br>The project also revealed how the game helped players see their own neighborhoods, like Lambeth, Whitechapel, and areas near the Thames, in a new historical light. Rather than just accepting the game's version of history, players used it as a starting point to question and research more. By immersing them in a detailed Victorian London, the game helped players connect emotionally with the struggles of that time, such as poverty, child labor, and mental health issues. This emotional link made players more interested in learning and reflecting on history<br><br></p>
