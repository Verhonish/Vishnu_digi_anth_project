        <p class="paragraph paragraph-1"><span class="paragraph-text-2">Introduction</span><br><br><br>The project investigates how historical narratives are constructed and experienced in virtual environments. Focusing on Assassin's Creed Syndicate, it examines the portrayal of London during the Second Industrial Revolution—a time of profound social and cultural change. The game provides players with an immersive experience of Victorian London, offering insights into a visual depiction of the lived experiences of the era. This approach allows for an exploration of how digital recreations influence our understanding of the cultural, social, and architectural aspects of the past.<br></p>

        <p class="paragraph paragraph-1"><span class="paragraph-text-3">Methodology</span><br><br>The project employs a mixed-method approach, combining gameplay analysis, historical research, and participant engagement to explore the intersection of virtual and physical spaces. Participants, who are residents of modern-day London boroughs, will play Assassin's Creed Syndicate and then revisit the actual locations depicted in the game. Through interviews, the study will gather insights into how these digital recreations resonate with their historical consciousness and lived experiences. This approach aims to uncover the ways in which digital media influence our perception of history.<br><br></p>
